## Project Overview
This repository focuses on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for indoor localization. A remote-controlled car with Raspberry Pi travels in a lab equipped with UWB anchors. The goal is to measure and analyze the positioning accuracy of UWB modules.

## Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi**: Control unit for the vehicle
- **DWM3001C Modules**: Used as both UWB anchors (beacons) and tag (client)


## Evaluation & Outlook
- **Measurement**: Gather UWB-based position data and calculate accuracy metrics (mean error, standard deviation)
- **Next Steps**: Cross-compare with BLE AoD repo; consider combining both technologies to enhance precision if resources allow.
